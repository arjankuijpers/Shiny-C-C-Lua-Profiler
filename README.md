# Shiny-C-C-Lua-Profiler
Fork of Sourceforge: Shiny is a lightning fast, fully documented &amp; by-far-easiest-to-use C/C++/Lua profiler with no extensive surgery. Results are smoothed &amp; shown in run-time as a call-tree or sorted-by-time. Output also renderable as graphs in Ogre3D or your custom engine. https://sourceforge.net/projects/shinyprofiler/?source=typ_redirect

## Unofficial fork.
